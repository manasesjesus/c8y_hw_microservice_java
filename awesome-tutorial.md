## Java and Built.io

### Overview

So, lets explore a bit the APIs and capabilities of Cumulocity. On this tutorial you will:

- Extend the "Hello world" Java microservice
- Raise alarms when new users subscribe to your microservice
- Add IP geotracking to your microservice
- Create a device in c8y to track your microservice API requests
- Create a workflow in built.io to:
  -- Verify that your microservice is up and running
  -- Notify a Slack channel if your microservice is down
  -- Raise a critical alarm in your tenant if your microservice is down

Sounds exiting? Let's the fun begin.
